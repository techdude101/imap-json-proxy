Supply chain trends can be a moving target. Mitigate disruption with Spectr=

New this month, the EDDI includes a featured category article focused on In=
ertial Measurement Units (IMUs). This level 3 category is not usually discu=
ssed in the monthly EDDI report, however it is one that has recently piqued=
 our interest because of the trends that are emerging. With the help of an =
industry expert, we take a deep dive into the data in the IMU subcategory, =
exploring the historical trends and comparing them to the current market.
The latest insights from Spectra=E2=80=99s Electronic Design to Delivery In=
dex (EDDI)

The Industry Supply Index continued its nine month steady increase for a to=
tal index value of 129 points. This 5 point increase adds to the overall 46=
.6% positive percentage change since the last low from April 2022.

The strongest Supply Index category for the month comes in again as Circuit=
 Protection, with a month-over-month increase of 6 points.

The Industry Demand Index reported a minor downward shift with a 3 point de=
crease overall, totaling 134 points for December. This continues the six mo=
nth aggregated downturn being seen across all category level demand indices=
.

Integrated Circuits maintained its position with the strongest demand index=
 value of 194 points, even with a 10 point decline this month. The outlier =
for demand trends in December was in Discrete Semiconductors which reported=
 a slight increase of 4 points, coming in at 166 points.
